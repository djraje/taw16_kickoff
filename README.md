# taw16_kickoff
This is the project for the TA Workshop Kickoff Presentation written using impress.js

## The files
* **index.html** if pretty much everything that’s there.   Everything is defined in the Div classes.  There is a lot of different syntax and tools/references on their github page.  I’d like to get Markdown support enabled to make some of the editing easier
* **index-demo.html** is the impress.js demo file
* **css/impress-taw.css**The css file I took straight from the Impress.js demo..and started tweaking it a bit.  I suggest we start with this and tweak as necessary
* **outline.txt** file for us to use for the outline of what goes where
* **deploy.sh** shell script that will deploy the code by logging in and pulling the latest from this repo
